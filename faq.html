    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>General</h2>
      <p><strong>Is ProfitPilot affiliated with eBay, Etsy, Amazon or any marketplace?</strong><br>
      No. ProfitPilot is an independent profit and pricing calculator. Marketplace names are shown only for user reference.</p>

      <p><strong>Is this financial or legal advice?</strong><br>
      No. All outputs are estimates based on your inputs. Estimates are for decision-making purposes only — consult professionals if needed.</p>

      <p><strong>Why do I need to log in?</strong><br>
      Login links your trial and PRO status to your account and prevents abuse. You can use some tools without logging in, but PRO features require it.</p>

      <h2>Free Trial & PRO</h2>
      <p><strong>How does the free trial work?</strong><br>
      You get a 5-day trial period. During trial some advanced features (e.g., reverse pricing, competitor mode, bulk) are limited.</p>

      <p><strong>Is PRO a subscription?</strong><br>
      No. PRO is a one-time purchase that unlocks unlimited access to all advanced features.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I unlock PRO after purchase?</strong><br>
      After purchase, PRO access is automatically granted to your logged-in account. If you switch devices or log out, simply log back in — the app will recognise your PRO status.</p>

      <p><strong>Why am I seeing an amount higher than the listed price at checkout?</strong><br>
      Paddle, our payment partner, may add VAT/sales tax where required by law. Paddle handles all tax compliance automatically on your behalf. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</p>

      <p><strong>What features are included in the free version?</strong><br>
      The free version includes basic profit and margin calculation and a short trial of advanced modes. Full features require PRO.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I see reviews without logging in?</strong><br>
      Yes. The Reviews page is public. Login is required to submit a review.</p>
