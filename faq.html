    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>General</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Is ProfitPilot affiliated with eBay, Etsy, Amazon, or any marketplace?</strong><br>
        No. ProfitPilot is an independent profit and pricing calculator. Marketplace names are used strictly for reference and familiarity. We are not endorsed by or connected to any marketplace.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Is ProfitPilot providing financial or legal advice?</strong><br>
        No. All calculations are estimates based on the data you enter. Results are intended to support pricing decisions only and should not be considered financial, legal, or tax advice.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why do I need to log in?</strong><br>
        Logging in securely links your trial and PRO access to your account and prevents abuse. Some basic tools may work without login, but PRO features require an account.

      <h2>Free Trial & PRO Access</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>How does the free trial work?</strong><br>
        You receive a 5-day free trial. During the trial, advanced features such as reverse pricing, competitor mode, and bulk tools may be partially limited.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Is PRO a subscription?</strong><br>
        No. PRO is a one-time purchase. Once unlocked, you get unlimited access to all current PRO features without recurring fees.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How do I unlock PRO after purchase?</strong><br>
        PRO access is automatically applied to the account you were logged into at checkout. If you change devices or log out, simply sign back in and your PRO access will be restored.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why is the checkout amount higher than the listed price?</strong><br>
        Our payment provider may apply VAT or sales tax where required by law. This is handled automatically at checkout in compliance with local regulations.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Refunds & Returns</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Do you offer refunds?</strong><br>
        Yes. Refunds are handled in accordance with our official policy. Please review the full details on our
        <a href="refunds.html">Refund Policy</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Why are refunds limited on digital products?</strong><br>
        Because ProfitPilot is a digital tool with instant access, refunds are evaluated based on usage and eligibility criteria outlined in the Refund Policy.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Using the App</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>What features are included in the free version?</strong><br>
        The free version includes basic profit and margin calculations along with a short preview of advanced modes. Full functionality requires PRO access.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Can I view reviews without logging in?</strong><br>
        Yes. The Reviews page is publicly accessible. Logging in is only required to submit a review.
